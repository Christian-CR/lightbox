# CSS3 Lightbox #

No js box and responsive, special lightbox to your projects and do not want to use more uncomfortable javascript plugins..

## Use ##

Just copy and paste the styles in your stylesheet. Copy this html code and replace what's inside:
<a href="#_" class="resaltado overflowBox" id="fl1">
<div class = "boxResaltado">
your html
</ div>
</ div>

You can add more links to the menu.
Just add more id (# fl4) to your links: id = "FL5" id = "fl6" and so on.

Similarly, do it in the href = "# FL5" on the links.

and enjoy your lighbox without javascript
